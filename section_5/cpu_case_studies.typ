Due to technical constraints, the number of cores that comprise contemporary multicore processors is limited, thereby constraining the achievable speed-up of CPU-parallelized programs in accordance with Ahmdal's Law (REF). At the time of this writing, the latest generation of Intel Core i9 processors for consumers has a maximum of 24 cores. Consequently, to further reduce execution times, it is necessary to explore alternative hardware solutions, such as Graphic Processing Units (GPUs) or Field Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs), which have emerged in the HPC field over the past decades @Vestias.

We decided to develop a GPU implementation of Watlab to pursue the work initiated in the previous thesis @Gamba on the previous and leverage the widespread presence of GPUs in consumer computers, originally designed for gaming. A functional and efficient GPU-enabled program would benefit many Watlab users.
