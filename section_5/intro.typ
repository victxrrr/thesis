The following section reviews the main steps explored to make Watlab faster. In a nutshell, we begin by profiling the code to empirically identify bottlenecks and analyze which parts can be accelerated and which cannot. We then present the main leads explored from a theoretical perspective. At the end of the section, execution times from the case studies are presented to empirically assess the benefits of each optimization.
