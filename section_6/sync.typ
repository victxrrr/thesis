The event based approach of the SYCL programming model is convenient for handling synchronization between the host and device when data needs to be output. Each task submitted to the SYCL queue is associated with a `sycl::event` on which the host can wait for completion. We store a pointer to this event, which is instantiated when the copy from device to host is requested. We wait on the event if the previous transfer has not finished or if one of the working output threads has not completed its previous task. Similarly, we also wait on this event before launching the update kernel to avoid overwriting cell data that is still being transferred back to the host.
