The last section presented a brief introduction to the wide range of possibilities for developing a GPU implementation of Watlab. Before discussing the approach we will take to achieve this, we first present the state of the art of solutions adopted by other researchers. 

Given the high degree of data parallelism exhibited by SWE resolution, hydraulic solvers mainly focus on parallelization and accelerators to reduce computational times.
